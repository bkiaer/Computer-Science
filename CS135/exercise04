C++ Arithmetic, Library Functions, and Assignment

For each of the following questions, replace the ________ with
your response.

Evaluate each of the following expressions. If the final result is
floating-point, include a decimal.

1. 27 % 7 - 8 / 3 => 4


2. 7 + 11 % 15 / 2 - pow(3,2) => 3


3. 4 * 2 / 5 + 4.5 => 5.5 


4. 4.0 * (2 / 5) + 2 => 2.0


5. 37 /5 % 4 - 3 * 1.0 => 0.0



Suppose a program contains the following declarations and assignment
statements. Assume cmath has been included in the program.

int x, y, z;
double a, b;
x = 14;
y = 5;
a = 7.8;

Answer each of the following questions. Include a decimal if the value
stored is floating-point.

6. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = 4 + x % 3;    z is 6


7. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = int(sqrt(a)) + y * 2;   b is 12.0  



8. What is stored in b after the statement is executed?

   b = y / 2 + 9.1;    b is 11.1



9. What is stored in z after the statement is executed?

   z = a - x % y + (x - 11) * 0.5;

   z is 5


10. What is stored in z after the statment is executed?

    z = a - double (x / y + 1);

    z is 4
    

After typing in your responses to each of the questions, use the
mail utility to email this file to your lab instructor.
